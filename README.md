# Goal-Bounding-on-NavMesh
Use of the Goal Bounding algorithm in a Navigation Mesh. This technique is capable of increasing the speed of A* by about 10x-20x.

We do not know if we are the first to do this since this algorithm is still very recent. The original work in Goal Bounding was created by Steve Rabin and used a Grid-based map. You can find is work at: https://github.com/SteveRabin/JPSPlusWithGoalBounding
